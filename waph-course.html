        <h2>Intoduction</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>In this course, students will study basic web application development with front-end

(HTML5, JavaScript, CSS) and back-end (PHP/MySQL). Web application vulnerabilities and attacks will be introduced and explored with hands-on exercises on the range. Secure programming principles and

practices will be introduced to avoid potential web application vulnerabilities and attacks.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Hands on projects</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>In this course, I have done few hands on labs and hackathons.Listed below:</li>
            <li>Lab 1 - Foundations of the Web .Intoduction to web applications</li>
            <li>Lab 2 - Front-end Web Development. Basic HTML, Css and Java script</li>
            <li>Hackathon 1 - Cross-site Scripting Attacks and Defenses : <br> This hackathon consists of multiple hands-on exercises covered in Lectures 7-8, where you would perform cross-site scripting attacks on multiple levels to understand the vulnerabilities as well as defense methods. </li>
